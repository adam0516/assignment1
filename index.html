      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <h6>Adam Murray - Feb 7, 2023</h6>
      <p>If I were to redo this I would probably use an object to store up to 2 streets and use that
        for selections instead of searching thru the dom. <br/>
        I would also use a better algorithm for the street detection which would combine varients of streets
        which would signifigantly reduce the number of streets to choose from. <br/>
        Also instead of chips for the selection I think a combined dropdown/search would be better. <br/>
        Lastly I would use better styling for more consistant sizes of the intersection images that fit 
        the screen perfectly when only one is selected.
